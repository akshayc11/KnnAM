* KNN Acoustic Model
** Introduction
   This is the implementation of a Nearest Neighbor Acoustic model using GPUs
   The KNN is performed using GPUs
** Algorithm
Objects:
data
label
index
gpu
distance
loglik
point

*** TODO Get the training data
*** TODO Get the training Labels
*** TODO Sort the training data index based on the label
*** TODO Transpose the sorted training data 
*** TODO Transfer the transposed data into the GPU
*** TODO Get the testing data
*** TODO Get the K nearest neighbors and their distances for the test data points
*** TODO Convert above information into log likelihood for each label for the given point
*** TODO Store the log likelihood information in output


** Implementation Details:
*** Iteration 1:
    Get training data and labels from pFile and store it in the CPU
   
**** Objects:
    + Base: DataBase
      Base Class for DataCPU, DataGPU, DataPFile 
    + Inherited from Base:
      1. DataPFile_old: old implementation of pFile
	 * Should go out of context once it passes its information to DataCPU
      2. DataCPU:
	 *

* KNN Acoustic Model
** Introduction
   This is the implementation of a Nearest Neighbor Acoustic model using GPUs
   The KNN is performed using GPUs
** Algorithm
Objects:
data
label
index
gpu
distance
loglik
point

*** Get the training data
*** Get the training Labels
*** Sort the training data index based on the label
*** Transpose the sorted training data 
*** Transfer the transposed data into the GPU
*** Get the testing data
*** Get the K nearest neighbors and their distances for the test data points
*** Convert above information into log likelihood for each label for the given point
*** Store the log likelihood information in output

* KNN Acoustic Model
** Introduction
   This is the implementation of a Nearest Neighbor Acoustic model using GPUs
   The KNN is performed using GPUs
** Algorithm
*** Get the training data
*** Sort the training data index based on the label
*** Transpose the sorted training data 
*** Transfer the transposed data into the GPU
*** Get the testing data
*** Get the K nearest neighbors and their distances for the test data points
***
